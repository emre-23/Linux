#Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. 
An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the 
communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn?t function.

#Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source follows these key tenants:

The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

#Create your first VM based on Centos Distrubiton (VmWare or Virtualbox or GCloud)
>What is Distrubiton:
__Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, you’ll find a “flavor” of Linux to match your needs. 
These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros”). Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive),
and installed (on as many machines as you like).

Popular Linux distributions include:

LINUX MINT
MANJARO
DEBIAN
UBUNTU
ANTERGOS
SOLUS
FEDORA
ELEMENTARY OS
OPENSUSE

#SSH authantication
SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over
an unsecured network. In addition to providing secure network services, SSH refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol. Secure Shell provides strong 
password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet. 
In addition to providing strong encryption, SSH is widely used by network administrators for managing systems and applications remotely, enabling them to log in to another 
computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.

#Go to your local host or another client
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id username@centosmachine_ip
#you'll be able to login without password to your centos machine from another computer or VM.

#Long way description of rssh authentication without password
cat /.ssh/id_rsa_pub/authorized_keys
#copy this code and paste in to your centos machine in where
cd ./ssh
touch authorized_keys
wq! // After press escape type wq! means write&quit

#If you've set up your machine on Virtualbox,  you will need to go Settings -> Network -> NAT binding -> Advance Setitngs and ive public and machine port
#ssh port is 22 so you may give 2222 port number to connect your machine
#Simple command shoudl be like this
ssh root@10.0.2.15 -p 2222


#Install nginx and configure listen port
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum -y install nginx
systemctl start && status nginx
